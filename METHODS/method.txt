------------- IMPORTING INTO UNITY -------------

Get all requirements
Load your APK into AssetRipper (don't change settings)
Click Export and don't make a new folder it will already make a folder
Load the project into unity (it should be AssetRipperExport64876474687346342 or something and then ExportedProject)
Press yes to everything qand if it tells you you dont have the version just ignore that
Once done go to Scenes/Gorilla/Gorilla Tag and open the GorillaTagSJ, GorillaTagSJR or GorillaTagNewVisualsCosmetics Scene

------------- FIXING SHADERS -------------

ONLY DO THIS IS EVERYTHING IS PINK!!!

Click on something then from shader GorillaLerp or something press Standard and do this to everything

------------- TEXT FIXING -------------

ONLY DO THIS STEP IF NO TEXT IS SHOWING!!!

Go to Window and Package Manager
Go to Unity Registry instead of My Assets or In Project
Import TextMeshPro
Restart your project

------------- PACKAGE REIMPORTING (FIXING SOME ERRORS) -------------

Check Console for errors from different parts of the folder "Scripts"
Reimport every package from the errors, most packages are free but some like MeshBaker are paid but can be easially pirated

------------- DUPLICATE SCRIPT FIXING -------------

If you get an error that a method is already called with the same parameters just delete the script

------------- STRUCT LAYOUT FIXING -------------

If you get an error thats like :
 Assets\Scripts\Oculus.VR\OVR\OpenVR\IVRCompositor.cs(61,4): error CS0592: Attribute 'StructLayout' is not valid on this declaration type. It is only valid on 'class, struct' declarations.
or 
    Assets\Scripts\Oculus.VR\OVR\OpenVR\RenderModel_t_Packed.cs(6,3): error CS0121: The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'StructLayoutAttribute.StructLayoutAttribute(short)' and 'StructLayoutAttribute.StructLayoutAttribute(LayoutKind)'

just delete the StructLayout thing in the script

ONLY DO THIS IF YOU REIMPORTED PACKAGES
